# Music_Recommendation_System
A music recommendation system that scans a user's face and plays a playlist of songs according to emotions(mood) detected on user's face.
The dataset used is the FER 2013 dataset from Kaggle.

### NOTE - I have not uploaded the dataset used to train the model and also not uploaded the song playlists
